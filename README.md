#### **_Description_**
A meditation app for the fringe

The market for meditation and relaxation apps is largely skewed to a specific demographic, which not all of us belong to. The goal here is to create an environment, or a Cyber Sangha, for those of us who like a little bit of the fringe elements of society and therefore feed our brains what it needs to attain a fully relaxed and meditative state.

Users will gain access to a library of continuously updating guided meditations, aural relaxation tracks, visual relaxation aides and have the ability to like and comment on these items. Users will also have the ability to update their profile information and delete their activity.

Their is also the ability to apply and join the community of creators to share your own guided meditations and posts.
